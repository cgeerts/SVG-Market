# Icon Marketplace

This project is for practicing with the creation of SVG files with intractable segments.
I chose to include my own simplistic renditions of icons from social media sites that I
use with the chance that I can edit and use them in the future for personal projects. 
Their round and bold features make them appear to be clickable to the user.
